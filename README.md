# Snake-Video-Game
I built a simple snake video game using javascript and html.
There are currently two versions of the game, one thats a classic and the other that has various pickups (gold increases by 5 and blue reduces by 2).
To run them, all you have to do is drag the html file into a browser.

The next stage in this video game is to add speed based powerups and enemies. Once complete, This repository will be updated.

Try them out and have fun!
